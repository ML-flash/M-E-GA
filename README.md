# Mutable Encoding enabled Genetic Algorithm (MEGA)

## Description
With corporate influence over Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning growing more and more every day, I believe it is essential for there to be ML projects brought into the sphere of public control and ownership. The Mutable Encoding Enabled Genetic Algorithm (MEGA) is intended as a foundational first step towards the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence as a public asset.

MEGA is a passion project of mine that I have been working on for a very long time. It represents years of thought, consideration, and study; 20 in fact (more than half my life). The aim of MEGA is to bring new ideas into the sphere of Evolutionary Algorithms. Through leveraging these new ideas, I hope to provide advancements in the field such as:

- Trivialized transfer learning.
- More biologically inspired computing models.
- Rapid iteration and deployment through a general-purpose encoding scheme and easily deployable framework.
- A lower barrier to entry in the form of domain-specific encodings.
- Providing new approaches to Evolutionary Algorithms in general, offering fresh paths for research and advancement. (hopefully)

## Key Points
- MEGA takes an entirely different approach to GA, making it both the same and fundamentally different from traditional approaches. It enables a Meta-Evolution of the gene representation. Through the continual capturing, nesting, and refinement of new meta-genes, MEGA enables the GA to learn about the search space in a very real tangible way that can be transferred to a newly initialized GA instance. This provides faster fitness gains that typically exceed the GA they originated from.
- xxhash is used to generate the hashable encodings. They aren't used in a hash table. I don't know enough about that to get it going. functools is used in the M_E_engine to allow for meta-gene caching using least recently used to enable faster decoding, mitigating the overhead created by nested meta-genes. concurrent is used to facilitate threading when evaluating a population. This helps again with organism decoding and fitness evaluation speed.
- The main challenges I encountered while developing MEGA were delimiter management. Start and End delimiters have a direction and not respecting that during mutations and crossover causes problems that are sometimes hard to detect. This was a pain, and if you look at the code, most of the helper functions are geared around ensuring delimiters are detected and handled properly. So if you start playing with things and everything seems to work but something is off, pass the verbose=True flag when decoding, and it will print out the values as it's decoding, and you can see if there are mismatched Start, End delimiters.

## How to Install and Run MEGA

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine.
- Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- xxhash is the only additional dependancy you will need.



## How to Install and Run MEGA

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine.
- Make sure you have Anaconda installed.
- `xxhash` is the only additional dependency you will need.

### Steps to Clone the Repository

1. **Open your terminal (or Anaconda Prompt)**

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ML-flash/M-E-GA.git
   ```

3. **Navigate into the project directory**
   ```sh
   cd M-E-GA
   ```

4. **Create a new conda environment and activate it**
   ```sh
   conda create --name mega_env python=3.8
   conda activate mega_env
   ```

5. **Install the required dependencies**
   ```sh
   conda install -c conda-forge xxhash
   ```

6. **Run the experiment**
   ```sh
   python M_E_GA_single_run.py
   ```

This will set up the project on your local machine and run the experiment using the provided script. Follow these steps precisely to ensure a successful installation and setup.

Alternativly you can use M_GA_2_Learn.py
This is the experiment that demonstrates Transfer learning. The paramiters of the instructor dictate the learnign process that is passed to the Student and its a little touchy. Im trying to figure out a reliable way to control the learnign rate but it will involve some research to figure out the best way to accomplish this. So if you are having trouble getting good results play around with the mutation rates. There are a lot of them and they are interdependant. Its not overly sensitive but if you arent getting the intended results ite likely due to mutation rates beign disproportional to eachother. 

This will set up the project on your local machine. Make sure to follow these steps precisely to ensure a successful installation and setup.

## How to Use MEGA
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also, if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
