To whoever discovers this,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Allow me to introduce you to the essence of my life’s endeavor—Singularity Search with Mutable Encoding. This is not just a genetic algorithm; it is a paradigm-shifting approach that meta-evolves gene representation itself.

It is with a mixture of pride and melancholy that I share this work, the culmination of my lifelong dedication to the field. I entrust this creation to you, carrying the hope that it will be used to forge paths towards benevolent advancements.

May it serve you well. Please, use it to make a difference in the world.


Thank you.
