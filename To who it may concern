To whoever discovers this,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Allow me to introduce you to the essence of my lifeâ€™s endeavor Singularity Search with Mutable Encoding. This is not just a genetic algorithm; it is a paradigm-shifting approach that meta-evolves gene representation itself.

It is with a mixture of pride and melancholy that I share this work, the culmination of my lifelong dedication to the field. I entrust this creation to you, carrying the hope that it will be used to forge paths towards benevolent advancements.

May it serve you well. Please, use it to make a difference in the world.


Thank you.
M_E_GA_Base V2 is the encoding Engien it fasctilitates the entire System. M_E_GA_Base V2 id the GA Base Class with the fitness function abstracted away for easy deployment. There are several examples showing its implimentation and use. I genuinly hope this contributes to the field.
I think it is capable of open ended evolution if applied properly and it is definately capable of transfer learning and life long learning through the transfer of the created encoding structures. I havent finished testing it yet but I believe it is atleast in part self adapting and regulating. 

I used GPT to bring my vision to reality and now Im done with it it cost me pretty much everything in life I care about. Thank you and good luck.
