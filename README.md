Introduction

Mutable Encoding Enabled Genetic Algorithm (MEGA) is designed to be a foundational first step towards the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence as a public asset.

In the current AI and Machine Learning (ML) landscape, the public should be aware of the significant influence corporations wield over the future of AI/ML. By leveraging the limited understanding of government officials and manipulating public perception through hype and fear, these corporations position themselves to dominate the industry, stifling fair competition.

While the claim that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is imminent is debatable, it raises a critical question: Should we allow profit-driven corporations, employing questionable tactics, to influence laws and dictate the future of humanityâ€™s technological advancements?

This is why MEGA is open source. Our goal is to empower the public to understand, use, and develop AI independently. We aim to serve as an educational resource, foster a community, and create a counterculture to the corporate domination of AI/ML policy and market control.
